CTRLMENU(1)                 General Commands Manual                CTRLMENU(1)

NAME
     ctrlmenu – unified menu system for X11

SYNOPSIS
     ctrlmenu [-it] [-a keysym] [-r keychord] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     ctrlmenu reads a text file describing entries in a hierarchical menu, and
     creates input methods for selecting and entering those entries.  When an
     entry is selected, its respective command is run in a subshell.

     The options are as follows

     -a keysym
             The symbol for the alt key (none by default).  Despite its name,
             this key can be any key.

     -i      Ignore case on the runner.

     -t      Enables tornoff menus.

     -r keychord
             The keychord to invoke the runner (A-space, by default).  The
             keychord must be a keysym, prefixed with C- (for Control), S-
             (for Shift), A- (for Alt), W- (for Super/Win).

     Each line read from the specified file or stdin can be a separator, a
     terminal entry, a common meta-entry, or a pipe meta-entry.  Any blank
     around an entry is ignored

           <ENTRY>     := <SEPARATOR> | <TERMINAL> | <META> | <PIPE>
           <SEPARATOR> := "--\n"
           <TERMINAL>  := <NAME> ["[" <KEYCHORD> "]"] ["--" <COMMAND>] "\n"
           <META>      := <NAME> "{\n" <ENTRIES>... "}\n"
           <PIPE>      := <NAME> "--" <COMMAND> "{\n" <SCRIPT> "}\n"

     Separator
             A separator is an anonymous, non-selectable entry in the menu.
             Separators are composed by a line with only two dashes in it.

     Terminal Entry
             A terminal entry is a line composed by a name, an optional
             keychord between square braces, and an optional command after two
             dashes.

     Common Meta-Entry
             A common meta-entry is a line composed by a name followed by an
             open curly bracket, then a sequence of entries, followed by a
             close curly bracket.

     Pipe Meta-Entry
             A pipe meta-entry is a line composed by a name followed two
             dashes and a command.  Then a shell script between curly braces.
             The given shell script is run and its output is read for
             generated menu entries.

     The name can have a underscore before the entry's alt character.

     A keychord has the following form.  An “S-” prefix indicates that the
     Shift key modifier is active.  An “C-” prefix indicates that the Control
     key modifier is active.  An “A-” prefix indicates that the Alt key
     modifier is active.  An “W-” prefix indicates that the Super (Also known
     as “windows key”) key modifier is active.  The keysym that forms the
     ending of the keychord is one of the keysyms listed at the
     /usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h file (/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h in
     some systems.)

           <KEYCHORD>  := ("S-"|"C-"|"A-"|"W-")... <KEYSYM>

USAGE
     The following input methods are provided by ctrlmenu

     Menu Dockapp
             The menu dockapp is an always-visible dockapp window that
             displays a list of menus.  The menus can be browsed with the
             mouse and each entry can then be clicked to be entered.  After a
             menu is opened, they can be navigated using the arrow keys and
             the Tab, Esc, and Enter keys.

     Alt Key Sequences
             Each menu entry can be bound to a character.  After pressing the
             alt key (set with the -a command-line option), it is possible to
             navigate the menus by pressing the letters of entries in
             sequence.

     Accelerator key chords
             Each menu entry can be bound to a key chord.  Pressing a key
             chord enters the entry bound to it.

     Runner  The runner is a window that is visible after pressing the runner
             key chord (Alt + space, by default). The runner displays a text
             input field where the user can type in a text to filter entries,
             and select an entry using Tab and Shift Tab.  When the user
             presses Return, the selected entry is entered.

                   Take _Screenshot [A-S]             -- exec scrot

           _Window {
                   Stic_k Container [A-S-S]           -- exec shodc state -y
                   S_hade Container [A-S-N]           -- exec shodc state -s

                   --
                   _Go To Desktop {
                           Go To Desktop _1 [A-1]     -- exec shodc goto 1
                           Go To Desktop _2 [A-2]     -- exec shodc goto 2
                           Go To Desktop _3 [A-3]     -- exec shodc goto 3
                           Go To Desktop _4 [A-4]     -- exec shodc goto 4
                           Go To Desktop _5 [A-5]     -- exec shodc goto 5
                   }
                   Move Container _To {
                           Move to Desktop _1 [A-S-1] -- exec shodc sendto 1
                           Move to Desktop _2 [A-S-2] -- exec shodc sendto 2
                           Move to Desktop _3 [A-S-3] -- exec shodc sendto 3
                           Move to Desktop _4 [A-S-4] -- exec shodc sendto 4
                           Move to Desktop _5 [A-S-5] -- exec shodc sendto 5
                   }
                   --
                   _Close Window [A-S-Q]              -- exec shodc close
           }

     This input creates a dockapp window with two buttons: “Apps” and
     “Window”.  The underline on the names of those entries in the input file
     indicates that pressing the alt key (set with the -a command-line option)
     underlines the letter “A” in “Apps” and the letter “W” in “Window”
     buttons, so pressing the key A or W opens the menus for the apps or
     window controlling.  Each window can also be opened by clicking on those
     buttons.

     On the “Apps” menu, an entry called “Open Terminal” can be clicked to run
     exec xterm on a terminal.  This entry can also be selected by the
     following methods:
     •   Pressing Alt-T (the accelerator keychord).
     •   Pressing T (the alt key) when the menu is open.
     •   Typing "Open Terminal" (or any substring) after pressing Alt-space
         (or any other keychord set with the -r command-line option) to open
         the runner.

BUGS
     ctrlmenu is created to work with the shod(1) window manager.  Although it
     probably works on fvwm(1), support for other window managers is not
     planned.
